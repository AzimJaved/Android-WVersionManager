Android-WVersionManager
====================

## Objective
- Whole point of this fork is to convert library to an Android Studio project and remove depency on deprecated org.apache.http library (replacing all calls with URLConnection or HttpURLConnection).

Compiled .jar file can be downloaded from [jar folder in this repo](https://github.com/revanmj/Android-WVersionManager/tree/master/jar) or [releases tab]().

You can read original readme with all details about the setup here: https://github.com/winsontan520/Android-WVersionManager/blob/master/README.md
